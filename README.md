# Support-Vector-Machines

Implemented a linear support vector machine with 3-fold cross validation by solving the primal formulation on the dataset available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetic+Retinopathy+Debrecen+Data+Set. Also used the linear SVM provided by LIBSVM which solves the dual formulation and compared the results.
